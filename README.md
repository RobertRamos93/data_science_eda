# Intro

Raw data rarely arrives in perfect condition. That's why the EDA (*Exploratory Data Analysis*), and thus, data cleaning, is a powerful tool.

In this notebook, I display my data analysis tools on the dataset [*Cafe Sales - Dirty Data for Cleaning Training* by Ahmed Mohamed in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamed2003/cafe-sales-dirty-data-for-cleaning-training/data).

## Overview
>"The Dirty Cafe Sales dataset contains 10,000 rows of synthetic data representing sales transactions in a cafe. 

>This dataset is intentionally "dirty," with missing values, inconsistent data, and errors introduced to provide a realistic scenario for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). 

>It can be used to practice cleaning techniques, data wrangling, and feature engineering."

The dataset includes the following column names:
* Transaction ID
* Item
* Quantity
* Price Per Unit
* Total Spent
* Location
* Transaction Date
